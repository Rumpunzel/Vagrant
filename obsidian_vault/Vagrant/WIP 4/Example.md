## The Escape

> Laynor and Thorm have been captured by a band of bandits. The blackguards have made camp in a dense forest next to the bank of a wide river. They have secured their captives on posts hammered into the ground and are now drinking and playing cards around their campfire.
>
>**Laynor:** "I want to wind out of these constraints."
>
>**GM:** "The rope is tied too tight around your wrists to get out if this easily."
>
>**Thorm:** "I shimmy to my feet and press the pole into my back and try to lift it from the ground."
>
>**GM:** "Slowly, steadily, the pole loosens in the earth. Laynor, is there anything you want to do while Thorm attempts to break free?"
>
>**Laynor:** "For now I simply want to watch the bandits to see if they notice this."
>
>**GM:** Smart move. Thorm, you manage to pull the post more and more out of the earth. Finally, you pull it out entirely, but as you do, one of the bandit's eyes glances over to where you are secured."
>
>**Laynor:** "Thorm, head down!"
>
>**GM:** "The bandit's eyes focus as he stares into the darkness."
>
>**Thorm:** "Damn, damn, damn! No, I don't think so, I'm not getting caught like that. I remain as still as I possibly can."
>
>**GM:** "Then give me a Nerves save."
>
>**Thorm:** "Getting caught is not an option, so full effort, all d12s I go, all 3 of them... I got a 2, a 6, and a 12! 12 it is!"
>
>**GM:** "You blend into the shadow, into the reeds around you. The bandit's eyes rest on you but are sooner distracted by the dice game than they realise what they see."
>
>**Thorm:** "Whew, too bad I lost 2 of my effort dice for that. Only the one left. And my hands are still bound. I only got free of the pole."
>
>**Laynor:** "Still totally worth it. Now get me out of this."
>
>**Thorm:** "Alright, I at least get my hands in front of me and then I untie Laynor."
>
>**GM:** "Besides the campfire, there is no light in the forest and, as you said, your own hands are still bound. It will take some time to untie that knot."
>
>**Thorm:** "I grew up a fisherman, I don't think a knot in the dark will be a problem for me."
>
>**GM:** "Fair enough. It takes only a moment until your hands are free, Laynor."
>
>**Laynor:** "Thanks, old pal, now it's my turn to get you free."
>
>**Thorm:** "No time. We have to go before they notice. Let's take the direct route straight through the river."
>
>**Laynor:** "What about that your gear? The bandits still have your weapon and your chainshirt."
>
>**Thorm:** "Gods be damned, you're right! You think you can get those for me while I catch my breath?"
>
>**Laynor:** "I make into the shadow, to their leader's tent. I am sure all their treasure is there."
>
>**GM:** "The bandits are too preoccupied with their dice game to notice you skulking from shadow to shadow."
>
>**Laynor:** "Perfect. I slip into the tent and take whatever is not nailed down and I can carry."
>
>**GM:** "You swiftly find Thorm's trident. The bandits had no use for that. But before you can gather any more riches, you hear the soft sound of breathing; someone is sleeping in the tent. A child, no older than 10. Her eyelids flutter as she stares into the darkness where you are standing."
>
>**Laynor:** "A sleeping child? This could be terrible news or but a nuisance. I'm going to risk it. *Go back to sleep,* I say in a commanding tone."
>
>**GM:** "A commanding tone to a strange child without startling her and without the bandits hearing you? Seems a lot trickier than it sounds."
>
>**Laynor:** "I always keep my cool in these kinds of situations. Nerves save with d8s: 7, 7, 8. A total of 8 and I lose 1 effort die. That almost really sent me. Do I know this child? Something feels quite off here."
>
>**GM:** "The child murmurs something before it dozes off again. To determine if you know her would extend your visit in this tent."
>
>**Laynor:** "Forget it. I am here for Thorm's valuables. I grab them and off I go to the riverbank."
>
>**GM:** "You find everything you were looking for and a purse of some kind on top."
>
>**Laynor:** "Perfect. And off I go."
>
>**GM:** "Don't forget, Thorm's gear is heavy. A total bulk of 2. And noisy. Metal on metal. That sounds practically attracts bandits."
>
>**Laynor:** "I get it, I get it. Nerve save. But they're distracted by their dice game. I'm sure I'll get by just fine. Not that I have much of a choice. Still need to make it through the river without drowning. I'll roll my remaining 2 effort dice as d6s. 3 and 6. Another die lost but that's as good as I could hope. I slip open the tent flap and into the night."
>
>**GM:** "The bandits are still occupied with their game. Around the tent you sneak. And stumble right into one of the scoundrels relieving himself behind the tent. He stares at you with wide open eyes, clearly surprised but you have been found."
>
>**Laynor:** "Damn it! I run for the river and shout to Thorm to get to safety."
>
>**Thorm:** "Off into the river I jump. I don't want to be swept away by the current, so I will resist it with a Guts save. A d10 should suffice; a 7."
>
>**GM:** "You fight against the current as Laynor runs for his life. The bandit already called for his brothers in crime but they are too far away to catch you bit the one with the empty bladder is right on your heels. You can feel a calloused hand grip your shoulder."
>
>**Laynor:** "I don't think so! I resist with all my might! Blood save with d12s... Dammit, only a 4 and a 5."
>
>**GM:** "His fingers slip off your shoulder. Because you surprised him, you had a sliver of a head-start -- exactly what you needed. But his hand finds the handle of the trident and he grips tightly."
>
>**Laynor:** "Thorm will have to get a new one. I chuck it at him and run away with the chainmail. Eat dust! Off into the river with me! No time for caution, all d12s again! 5 and 7. I loose both of them. I am now completely out of breath. Please tell me we made it across."
>
>**GM:** "7 is exatly what you needed. You made it both across and Thorm has his gear again. The bandits curse you from the other side of the river. But you are safe. Drenched and exhausted but safe."
>
>**Thorm:** "Incredible job, Laynor. Here, let me carry that stuff. A little swim is just what I needed. The rest of the journey is on me. Let's find some place to hide and then I will catch us some fish."
