Arms and armour and special equipment, which help you when you engage a foe. As with other equipment, arms and armour take up a certain amount of slots, though, most arms and armour are *bulky* and will increase your carry load.

## Armour
Armour protect you from the worst of physical injuries. Reduce all damage you take by the total protection value of armour you wear. This may negate the entire amount.
There are three types of armour: **Gambeson,** **Chainmail,** and **Plate.** Each takes up 3 slots and is considered *bulky.*
Wearing only a gambeson grants you **1** protection. A gambeson and chainmail grant **3** and all three combined grant a total of **6** protection.

## Shields
When you engage a foe, while wielding a shield, roll your shield's skill die. If the result exceeds your **Guts** score, you are unable to properly utilise the shield and its properties in this exchange. Otherwise, add the die to your manoeuvre roll.
Bigger shields have bigger skill dice, hence are harder to wield but also offer greater protection to you.

|   Shield    | Skill | Slots |
| :---------: | :---: | :---: |
|   Pavise    |  d10  | **3** |
| Roundshield |  d8   | **2** |
|   Buckler   |  d6   | **1** |

## Bludgeons
When you engage a foe armed with nothing but a crude instrument, such as a club, a stone, fisticuffs, or your shield, double any damage you deal to your foes.

## Close-Quarter Weapons
When you engage a foe armed with a close-quarter weapon, roll your weapon's skill die. If the result exceeds your **Guts** score, you are unable to use that weapon and its properties in this exchange. Otherwise, add the die to your threat roll and double any damage you deal to your foes. If you wield the weapon with both hands or while mounted, triple it instead.
Longer weapons have bigger skill dice, hence are harder to wield but also pose a greater threat to your foes.

### Skirmish Weapons
While wielding an axe, hammer, mace, halberd, or similar instrument, double (or triple) the damage you deal before it is reduced by your foe's armour.

|  Weapon   | Skill | Slots |
| :-------: | :---: | :---: |
|  Halberd  |  d12  | **3** |
| Warhammer |  d10  | **2** |
|    Axe    |  d8   | **2** |
|   Mace    |  d6   | **2** |

### Fencing Weapons
When you engage a foe armed with a fencing weapon, roll your weapon's skill die. If the result does not exceed your **Blood** score, you may choose to to add the result to your foe's skill die result (before you know the result), making the weapon harder to use and potentially rendering it unusable for that exchange (or more dangerous for you if your opponent is skilled).

|   Weapon   | Skill | Slots |
| :--------: | :---: | :---: |
| Greatsword |  d12  | **3** |
| Longsword  |  d10  | **3** |
|   Sword    |  d8   | **2** |
|   Knife    |  d6   |   1   |

### Polearms
When you engage a foe armed with a polearm, roll your arm's skill dice twice. If both results exceeds your **Guts** score, you are unable to use that weapon and its properties in this exchange. Otherwise, add the dice, which did not exceed your **Guts** score to your threat roll and you are able to use your weapon in this exchange.

| Weapon | Skill | Slots |
| :----: | :---: | :---: |
|  Pike  |  d12  | 3 |
| Glaive  |  d10  | 3 |
|  Spear |  d8  | 3 |
| Quarterstaff  |  d6  | 2 |

## Dual Wielding
When you engage a foe with two weapons or a weapon and a shield, if you are unable to use a weapon in an exchange because of the result of a skill die, you are unable to use both arms in that exchange.
Otherwise you may use both and add all skill dice to their relevant roll.

## Ranged Weapons
You may engage a foe from a distance with a ranged weapon but only if you use ammunition.
When you engage a foe from a distance, they may only threaten physical harm if they are also engaging you with a ranged weapon. Otherwise, you defend with your manoeuvre roll against them closing the distance to you.

### Bows
When you engage a foe armed with a bow, roll your weapon's skill die. If the result exceeds your **Nerves** score, you are unable to use that weapon and its properties in this exchange. Otherwise, add the die to your threat roll. You still threaten your foe with **Guts** to determine if you lose breath dice.

|  Weapon  | Skill | Slots |
| :------: | :---: | :---: |
| Longbow  |  d12  | **3** |
|   Bow    |  d10  | **3** |
| Shortbow |  d8   | **2** |

### Crossbows
You threaten foes with **Nerves** instead of **Guts** with a crossbow.
When you engage a foe armed with a crossbow, roll your weapon's skill die. If the result exceeds your **Nerves** score, you are unable to use that weapon and its properties in any exchange until you take an exchange to reload it. Otherwise, add the die to your threat roll.

|  Weapon  | Skill | Slots |
| :------: | :---: | :---: |
| Arbalest |  d10  | **3** |
| Crossbow |  d6   | **2** |
