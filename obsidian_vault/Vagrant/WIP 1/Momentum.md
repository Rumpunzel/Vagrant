Momentum is gained and lost through actions.
As long as your momentum is at least equal to the rating of your challenge, you are in control.
As long as you in control, you have more options at your disposal and a little bit more distance between you and disaster.

There are probably also other uses such as spending momentum to wither increase an attribute or skill for a roll.
