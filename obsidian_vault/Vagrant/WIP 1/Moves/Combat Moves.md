## Volley

On a miss you also spend 1 supply

- If you overwhelm your foe, roll Might
- If you dodge out of the way, roll Agility

- If you feint with tactics and trickery, roll Wits

On a strong hit, resolve the **strong hit effect** of a [[Strike]] or [[Maneuver]] move now and increase an attribute of your choice based on effect when determining effect for that move

A weak hit counts as a miss
