Effect : Heart  |  Special Move  |  Use only when out of control

- If you act with strength or endurance, roll Might
- If you act with balance or reflexes, roll Agility
- If you act with expertise or trickery, roll Wits
- If you act with charm or courage, roll Heart

On a strong hit, chose 1 (on a critical hit, choose 2):
- clear stress based on effect
- make another move now (not a progress move) and increase an attribute of your choice based on effect when determining effect for that roll

A weak hit counts as a miss
