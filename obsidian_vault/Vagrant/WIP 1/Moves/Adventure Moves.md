When you attempt something risky or react to an imminent threat,
envision your action and roll

## Effect



## Dice

Count only the highest die

- If you act with strength or endurance, roll Might
- If you act with balance or reflexes, roll Agility
- If you act with expertise or trickery, roll Wits
- If you act with charm or courage, roll Heart

## Strong Hit

If it is a 6, you get a strong hit
If you rolled two 6's, you get a critical hit
On a strong hit you get what you want and choose 1 (on a critical hit choose 2):
- gain +1 momentum
- mark +1 progress (if applicable)
- clear -1 stress

## Weak Hit

If it is a 4-5, you get a weak hit
On a weak hit you get what you want but you suffer stress equal to inverse effect and:
- if you are in control, lose momentum equal to stress
- otherwise, [[Endure Harm]]

## Miss

If it is a 1-3, you miss
On a miss you do not get what you want and you suffer stress based on inverse effect, lose momentum equal to stress, then you must [[Endure Harm]]
