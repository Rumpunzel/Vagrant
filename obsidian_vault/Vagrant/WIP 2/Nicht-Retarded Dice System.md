- Roll dice
	- From where? Skill? Attribute? Also obstacle?
- Either
	- Have attribute determine how many dice you keep (so you must also take wounds)
	- Have specific valid combinations you are allowed to keep (so the wounds are implicit)
- Throw away a number of dice (maybe from armour, or armour only can throw away certain faces, or attribute or something else)
- Leftover dice determine consequences
- Maybe different types of dice; maybe even different dice for different attributes/approaches



- Obstacle maybe gives dice?
- Dice from attribute maybe
	- Skill upgrades that many dice
- Obstacle "eats" X of the dice first (wounds activate special stuff for obstacles)
- Remaining dice are for the player

## Fantasy

- Dice not used to determine outcome of action but possible actions and their consequences
- Allocating dice as "lost opportunities to get to do what I want"
- If no opportunities are lost, suffer consequences
- Remaining dice outline remaining possible actions to take

## Dice Outcomes Needed

### Positive

- Hit (two hits maybe crit)
- Opportunity (different types perhaps? from personality dice?)
- XP?
- Gain momentum or something
- Defend?
- Positive narrative turn
- Increased effect
- Lessened effect
- Keep die for next action
- Blank?

### Negative

- Wound
- Special Move
- XP?
- Gain stress or something
- Blank
- Negative narrative turn
- Lessened effect
- Increased consequence
- Blank?

Foe determines die type poses threat
Will deal that much harm
Dice with faces can be used to surrendered to defend (effect determined by stat; each additional die increases stat by 1)
Remaining dice with faces can be used to attack (effect determined by stat; each additional die increases stat by 1) or for their face value
Possibly only attack OR defend not both unless feat or something
Skill increases dice rolled
Specific combination of faces can be combined for additional bonuses
Skulls can be surrendered but empower the foe if surrendered
Potentially add a custom player die

- Foe has a number of dice, which start as Skulls
- Player has a number of dice
- Each "round" player may roll any number of dice, of the foe and his own
- Result is consequences suffered/achieved
- All rolled dice are lost for the rest of the conflict
- Fantasy: Use own dice to "contest" and reroll foe's dice

- "Perception" compared to foe's "Speed" determines how many of the foe's dice you can see at a time
- Skill determines how many dice you roll
- Used dice are spent until reroll
- Take an action to reroll


---


- Foe has a Threat Level
- Choose and approach each round
- Need to surrender that many dices with faces or lose the conflict
- Dice without a face may be used as if they had a face but are then lost for the remaining conflict (but only for that Approach)
- Approaches determine special effect of rolling a special face (6 on the die)
- Approaches also determine harmful effect if using a desperate face (1 on the die) for an action
- Surrendering a desperate face, empowers the foe (default is that Threat increases)
- Attacks require 2 dice with faces
- May keep an unused die each round for the next round
- Still need to determine where dice come from (skills I suppose)
