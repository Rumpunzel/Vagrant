When you mean to do violence to a foe and they are unaware of you or otherwise unable to defend themselves, you do. But if they are, you must first present a threat.
To do so, roll as many of your breath dice as you choose as if making a **Guts** save. There is not difficulty, simply try to roll as high as you can. The highest result is the threat you present your foe.

Your foe may try to escape your threat by making a **Blood** save. If they succeed, they get away, if they fail, you inflict an injury equal to the difference.

Or your foe may brawl with you by presenting their own threat. In that case, they save with **Guts** and will instead inflict an injury on you if they succeed.

## Injuries
Reduce your attribute scores by the total sum of your injuries.

## Weapons
Weapons make violence much more dangerous. Each weapon is represented by a weapon die. The longer/bigger the weapon, the bigger the die.

When you threaten a foe with a weapon, also roll your weapon die. If the weapon die exceeds your **Guts** score, you are unable to effectively wield the weapon. Mark the weapon by crossing out the face of the die, then discard the die. When you mark an already marked face again, the weapon is ruined and no longer usable.

Otherwise, inflict an injury equal to your weapon die's result to your foe, not matter you rolled higher. If your threat exceeds your foe's and you threatened with **Guts,** increase the injury by the difference.

Alternatively, if you wield a weapon, you may threaten with **Blood.** When you do, and your threat exceeds your foe's, reduce the injury they inflict on you by the difference. When your foe is also armed, threatening with **Blood** is most often the sensible choice.





1. **Each side rolls their weapon dice.** The highest weapon die is the resulting threat. If there are multiple attackers, still only take the highest result.
2. **Each participant makes a manoeuvre roll to evade enemy threat.** This is a **Blood** save. If the result of the highest manoeuvre die does not at least meet their opponent's threat, the difference is inflicted as an injury.
   When defending as a group, each participant may give one of their manoeuvre dice to an ally.
3. **Injuries suffered in combat incapacitate.** Unless it was reduced by a manoeuvre die, then the injured must succeed on a **Guts** with the die to save against the sum of all their injuries to continue fighting.
4. **In many cases the fight is now over.** If both sides are still standing, they discard their highest manoeuvre die and reduce their opponent's threat by how many participants are still standing. If either side still has threat remaining, repeat with the remaining dice and threat.
   If both sides are still standing but their threats have been reduced to **0,** reevaluate and potentially reengage as if starting anew (this should basically not happen unless the participants are heavily armoured).

# Gambits
You may treat a single weapon die as manoeuvre die or vice versa if its result does not exceed your **Nerves** score.

# Vantage
If there are external (better training or equipment does not count) and one-sided circumstances such as darkness during an ambush, a stairwell during a duel, high ground etc., the favoured side gains *vantage.*
While you have *vantage* against a foe, they roll all their dice and make all their decisions (for example gambits) before you do. This includes your decision to run away.

# Weapons

Roll the weapon die to threaten a foe. In general you threaten a foe with **Guts.**

When you mark a weapon, cross out the face of the die and treat it as **0** until restored. When you mark an already marked face again, the weapon is ruined and no longer usable.

## Melee Weapons
*Knives, daggers, swords, axes, spears, hammers, halberds, flails, maces...*

Weapon die depending on length: **d6** *(1 slot, light)*, **d8** *(1 slot)*, **d10** *(2 slots)*, **d12** *(3 slots)*

If the result of the weapon die exceeds your **Guts** score, you are unable to wield the weapon: discard its weapon die and mark the weapon.

You may throw a melee weapon. When you do, roll its weapon die, though you only threaten harm to your foe if the weapon die exceeds neither your **Guts** nor your **Nerves** score. Either way, mark the weapon.

If the result of the weapon die exceeds your **Guts** score, you are unable to wield the weapon: discard its weapon die and mark the weapon.

While you have *vantage* over a foe, if the weapon die does not exceed your **Nerves** score, you may also add it to your manoeuvre roll.

While a foe has *vantage* over you, they deal their damage first.

### Contraptions

Add the shield die **d4** *(1 slot, light),* **d6** *(1 slot),* **d8** *(2 slots),* **d10** *(3 slots)* -- depending on size -- to your manoeuvre dice.
If the result of the shield die exceeds your **Guts** score, you are unable to wield the shield: discard its shield die and mark the shield.
